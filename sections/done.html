<h1>Done!</h1>

<p>In this tutorial we used BOSH to deploy services, updated our deployment with source changes, scaled the number of services and changed their properties. We recovered from failing service, failing VM and failing deploy.</p>

<p>We were using VirtualBox environment with Warden CPI (Cloud Provider Interface). Warden is a Linux container management tool and Warden CPI abstracts VMs as Linux containers. The Director can work with any CPI that implements a certain API to manage IaaS resources. There are several supported CPIs for different IaaS providers: AWS, GCP, Openstack, vSphere and vCloud. Read more about CPIs here: <a href="http://bosh.io/docs/cpi-api-v1/">http://bosh.io/docs/cpi-api-v1/</a>.</p>
